NoteTaker, a place where you can sort your mind. On this project we were supposed to connect all the files using Get, Post and Delete. 
Get allocates the json file then goes through the process of post. Post acknowledges the request vis jason and it prompts the request. Lastly the delete, deletes whatever the user does not need anymore. 

To use this app do the following: 

      1. Click create a new note. 
      2. Type whatever you need to be reminded of.
      3. If you are done with the the note, you can delete it by clicking the delete button
